LIFmy.m is my code for Leaky Integrate and Fire Model (Problem 2) \

To call it use [V,I,t,spikeTimes] = LIFmy(amp) where amp is the current you want to inject in nA, this is the same syntax like the question \

Plot graphs as 
```
plot(t,V)
plot(t,I)
```
Solutions in the pdf file besides the questions \
Code to plot Firing Rate vs I_e graph was deleted by me before saving hence skipped
