# MIT OCW 9.40 Neural Computation Solutions

The files in this folder are the official problem set files including my solutions. Each folder corresponds to a particuar problem set. The offical pdf file in each folder includes my answers too. Other points specific to a problem set are in the corresponding folder. Happy to receive feedback !

## Topics (Major Problem Sets Highlighted)
PS 1 - Diffusion, equivalent neuron circuit and Nernst potential \
PS 2 - Integrate and fire and Hodgkin-Huxley models \
PS 3 - Simulating 2 compartment models of dendritic and somatic inhibition \
***PS 4a - Analyzing Spike trains and tuning curves from neurons in the primary visual cortex** \
***PS 4b - Estimation of spectro-temporal receptive fields (STRF) with spiketriggered averaging (STA)** \
***PS 5 - Analyzing Epileptic vs Normal EEG signals from PFC**
PS 6a - Perceptron Classification \
***PS 6b - Dimensionality Reduction of Motor Cortex Neurons during arm reaching task and decoding neural activity** \
