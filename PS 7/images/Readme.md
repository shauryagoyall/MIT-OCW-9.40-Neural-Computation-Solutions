Some plots from the simulations

neuron given - simulation with given weights for 1 s \
neuron given 0.8s - simulation with given weights where input lasted 0.8s \
neuron or eigenmode markov - markov is the weight matrix i constructed. it is markov in nature. M_other = 0.8 here. Plot corresponds to neuron firing rate or eigenmode firing rate respectively
